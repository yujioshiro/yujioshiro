I am a second year Computer Science student at Irvine Valley College. I have applied to transfer to a 4-year university in Fall 2022 and will obtain an Associate's in CS in the meantime. 

- Experience building websites, Android applications, Arduino scripts, and have no issue learning new languages, libraries, and frameworks
- I enjoying building and fixing things (phones, computers, household appliances, cars...) and am fascinated by all types of machinery
- I love all things tech, so feel free to reach out if you want to discuss tech or collaborate on projects!
